## Reflection
This was a project I made during a break between semesters while getting my degree in CS. I wanted to build a minesweeper game because I loved playing it as a child. I've only done minimal coding with Javascript before, so I built this project using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build up my skills in those areas. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was scaling the game board when I wanted to create additional levels. ADD SOMETHING HERE ABOUT HOW IT WOULDN"T RESET CORRECTLY OR SCALE CORRECTLY. This led me to research... HOW DID I FIX IT?
